# **Traffic Sign Classifier** 


The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
 
### Project files

The project page is on [Github](https://github.com/pvishal-carnd/Traffic-Sign-Classifier). This writeup can at [writeup.md](writeup.md) and the Jupyter notebook, that has all the code can be accessed at [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) and as an html file, [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html) 

The dataset that was used is the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
